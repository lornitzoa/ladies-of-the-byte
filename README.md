# ladies-of-the-byte: Planit
WDIR Unit 3 Group Project

## Summary
Planit is an application for event and goal planning. A plan is created and then a user can add tasks with due dates to it. This project was built using Express, Angular, HTML, CSS, MongoDB and Mongoose, and an external API from thenounproject.com.


## Methodology & Approach


## Further Development
If we were to continue developing this I would like to include a calendar view where the user can see all tasks of all plans so make tracking of a variety of tasks easier.


## Struggles
Having a relatively short period of time this was a rather small project and we found that it was inevitable for us to require aspects of the same files while working on the pieces of the site that we each took on. We definitely had a number of merge conflicts which required us to push our experience with resolving and merging conflicts using GitHub.

### Anna
I took on the development of related models for our data base and connecting a 3rd party API. I relied heavily on Matt Huntington's instructor notes on this topic but had to do some converting from express to include angular. I struggled for a while on figuring out how to get a 3rd party API working through Angular and Express as previously I had only done it through jQuery Ajax calls. I used some external support links listed in the documentation of the API site and had to do some further testing and modification to code presented there to get everything working.
